# Flutter Sample Projects

This repository contains a few small Flutter applications that were used for practicing Flutter development.

## Projects

### archive_idea
A simple Flutter application for storing ideas. To run it:
```bash
cd archive_idea
flutter run
```

### business_card
A small demo showing a personal business card layout. To run it:
```bash
cd business_card
flutter run
```

### first_project
The first experiment project while learning Flutter. To run it:
```bash
cd first_project
flutter run
```

Each project has its own `pubspec.yaml` and can be built and run independently using the Flutter tooling. Make sure you have Flutter installed and configured on your machine.
